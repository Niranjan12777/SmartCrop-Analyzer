# SmartCrop-Analyzer
SmartCrop-Analyzer is an satellite-based agricultural monitoring system that leverages deep learning and spectral analysis to assess crop health, detect stress, and map moisture conditions. Using hyperspectral and multispectral imagery, the model applies UNet/CNN architectures along with vegetation indices to generate fine-resolution maps.
